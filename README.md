# Covid-Data-Project
Covid Data Exploration and Tableau Visualisation

In this project I looked into the data regarding Covid Vaccinations and Deaths from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .

In PostgreSQL the data from the Covid Deaths and the Covid Vaccinations files was explored in the file SQL-Queries_Data-Exploration-Covid.sql .

A visualisation was created in Tableau with the data from the queries in the file SQL-Queries-Tableau-Covid-Viz.sql .

The data used for the visualisations is in the four Covid_Tableau_Table files and can be found here
